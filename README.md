# Furry-Artwork
Just kidding, this is actually a collection of Advent of Code solutions.<br/>
Both parts of each problem are solved in each program.<br/>
However not everything is presented directly since AoC only requires a final answer.<br/>
If something is ambiguous details are usually given in comments or in the GitHub commits.<br/>
NOTE - Some programs (especially early ones) do not directly use the given input. Sometimes you must specify the number of input lines at the start of the input file (This number does not include the aforementioned number itself).<br/>
